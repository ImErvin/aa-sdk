# Setup

This guide will show you how to setup a node.js project to build a custom account with the aa-sdk. You'll also learn how to get your Alchemy API key which is required to initiate any action with the custom account.

## 1. Create a new project

Navigate to the directory in your terminal where you want to create your new project and run the following commands:
::: code-group

```bash [npm]
mkdir custom-accounts
cd custom-accounts
npm init es6 -y
```

```bash [yarn]
mkdir custom-accounts
cd custom-accounts
yarn init -y
```

:::

This will initialize a new node.js project called `custom-accounts` with a `package.json` file.

## 2. Install the packages

Next, install the required packages by running the following commands in your project directory:
::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -save-dev typescript
npm install @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-core @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-signers viem
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D typescript
yarn add @alchemy/aa-alchemy @alchemy/aa-core @alchemy/aa-accounts @alchemy/aa-signers viem
```

:::

This will install the following packages:

1. `@alchemy/aa-alchemy`: An aa-sdk package required when using Rundler (Alchemy's Bundler) or Gas Manager (Alchemy's Paymaster).
2. `@alchemy/aa-core`: An aa-sdk package that contains the core interfaces and components for interacting with the ERC-4337 infrastructure. Essential for interacting with smart accounts.
3. `viem`: A library that contains helpful abstractions and modules that are useful when using the aa-sdk. Additionally, many aa-sdk modules use `viem` themselves.
4. `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler. Required to compile the TS code that you'll write in subsequent guides.

## 3. Verify your node.js version

Make sure your `Node` version is _18.16.0_ using your version manager:

::: code-group

```bash [nvm]
nvm install 18.16.0
nvm use 18.16.0
```

```bash [asdf]
asdf install nodejs 18.16.0
asdf global nodejs 18.16.0
asdf reshim nodejs
```

:::

## 4. Get your Alchemy API key

To create a custom account and send userops, you'll need an Alchemy API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account at [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/). Once you have an account, navigate to the [Apps](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps) section of your dashboard and create a new app called `custom accounts`. Make sure to select the "Ethereum Sepolia" network when creating the app.

Once the app is created, you'll be able to access your API key from the app's settings page.

Save this API key as you'll need it later!

## 5. Create a .env file

To make things easier, create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following to it:

```env
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<your-key-from-above>
# we'll use this key to generate an owner for our account later
PRIVATE_KEY=<a-private-key-for-testing>
```

## 6. Create the index.ts file

Finally, create a new file called `index.ts` in the root of your project. This is where you'll write the code for your custom account.

::: details Using `dotenv` to load environment variables
One way to leverage the `.env` file above is to use `dotenv` to load the environment variables into your project. Install
::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install dotenv
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add dotenv
```

Then at the top of your `index.ts` file, add the following line:

::: code-group

```ts [index.ts]
import "dotenv/config";
```

You're now ready to start building your custom account! ðŸš€
